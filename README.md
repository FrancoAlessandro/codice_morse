# codice_morse
with this project we can write a word in the textbox shown thanks to the frontend, the word will be sent to the aws topic, thanks to the backend, which, using the arduino script, is converted into the morse code and reproduced via sound signals emitted by the buzzer we connect to the wemos with a blackboard.
